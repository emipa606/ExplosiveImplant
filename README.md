Update of ma1tas mod
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1816673839

- Lowered the value of the implant as 800 was a bit high
- The explosion should now always remove the pawns head since the implant is in the brain
- Added an advanced implant with twice the blast-radius
- Added a knockout implant that instantly sedates the pawn instead
- Corpses can now also be exploded
- Slaves with an explosive implant will always have 100% terror
